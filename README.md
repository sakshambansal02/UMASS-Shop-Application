# UMASS-Shop-Application


Overview
<br>
Hello! I'm excited to introduce the UMass Shop Application, a Java-based system I've developed to manage customer interactions in a shopping environment. This project includes classes for handling customer accounts, tracking purchases, and managing the overall shopping process.

<br> 

Files:
<br>
CustomerAccount.java:
<br>
This is a Java class that appears to manage customer accounts. It tracks a customer's name, the number of shirts and hats purchased, the total amount purchased, and the account balance.

<br> 
metadata.yml:
<br>

This file contains metadata in YAML format, including submitter information, creation date, status, and score. It seems to be related to the project's administration or submission details rather than its functionality.

<br> 

Proj 2 UMass Shop-starter.gpj:
<br>
This file appears to be a project file, possibly for a Java IDE like jGRASP. It's likely used to manage the overall project structure and settings.
<br>
<br>
ShoppingCenterMain.java: 
<br>
This Java class is the main entry point for the UMass Shop application. It manages interactions between customers and the program, using instances of CustomerAccount to track customer purchases and balances.
